	abstract = {In this qualitative study, we explore how incumbent firms in traditional industries build dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Digital transformation has been defined as the use of new digital technologies, such as mobile, artificial intelligence, cloud, blockchain, and the Internet of things (IoT) technologies, to enable major business improvements to augment customer experience, streamline operations, or create new business models. In making sense of digital transformation, we discovered that leaders in various industry circles use the term inconsistently to describe various strategizing and organizing activities; in addition, the term has gained limited scholarly attention as a context for study of strategic change. Drawing on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects at incumbent firms, we propose a process model comprising of nine microfoundations to reveal the generic contingency factors that trigger, enable, and hinder the building of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Our findings reveal that digital transformation is an ongoing process of using new digital technologies in everyday organizational life, which recognizes agility as the core mechanism for the strategic renewal of an organization's (1) business model, (2) collaborative approach, and eventually the (3) culture.},

	abstract = {In the digital era, organizations can use digital technologies to develop new digital products and services, business processes, or business models. These so-called digital innovations pose a serious challenge for both theory and practice. Accordingly, the last years have brought forward a multitude of research in this area. With this article we want to link existing research streams on digital innovations and, thus, pave the way for future research in this area. Therefore, we consolidate prevailing work on digital innovations into a technology-driven “linking” framework on digital innovations and their embedding in organizations. According to our framework, the realization and embedding of digital innovations into organizations manifests along three concentric rings: the technology-driven development and the different implementation categories of digital innovations at the core, the enablers of digital innovations in a second ring, and the governance of digital innovations in a third ring. Based on the proposed framework we point out promising areas for further research in this field.},

	abstract = {It’s problematic when companies decide to embark on a digital transformation agenda without having a clear definition, let alone vision, for what it means. The fundamental meaning of transformation is not about replacing old technologies with new ones, or capturing high volumes of data, or hiring an army of data scientists, or trying to copy some of the things Google or Amazon do. In fact, the essence of digital transformation is to become a data-driven organization, ensuring that key decisions, actions, and processes are strongly influenced by data-driven insights, rather than by human intuition. In other words, you will only transform when you have managed to change how people behave, and how things are done in your organization.},
